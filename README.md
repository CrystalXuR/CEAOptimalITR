# Censoring-OptimalClass
Modifying R package OptimalClass

The aim of this project is to modify the exsiting R code, 'OptimalClass', in package "DynTxRegime", so that the new R package/code will serve the purpose in my thesis topic, thatis, finding the patient-level optiaml treatment regime from a cost-effectiveness perspective. Since cumulative cost has informative censoring issue, we need to allow the code to compromise censoring weight adjustment as well as treatment weight adjustment. In addition, the composite outcome is also need to be considered.
