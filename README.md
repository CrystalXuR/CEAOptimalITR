# Estimating Optimal ITRs from a Cost-Effectiveness Perspective 
CEAOptimalITR is build based on the exsiting R code from Tao Y.. It estimates the optimal treatment rule that maximizes the joint contribution of both cost and effectiveness to a treatment. It also allows the consideration of individual heterogeneity, so, the resulting optimal treatment decision is personalized/tailored according to individual characteristics.
