# Optimal ITRs for a Cost-Effectiveness Outocme 
Creating R package based on Tao Y.'s multi-stage code

The aim of this project is to modify the exsiting R code from Tao Y. to adapt it to a cost-effectiveness analysis for survival outcomes.  The new R package/code will serve the purpose in my thesis topic, that is, finding the patient-level optimal treatment regime from a cost-effectiveness perspective. The package will allow to input two outcomes: effectiveness and cumulative cost.
