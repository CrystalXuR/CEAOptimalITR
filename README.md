# Estimating the Optimal ITR from a Cost-Effectiveness Perspective 
CEAOptimalITR is a package for estimating the optimal individualized treatment rule from a cost-prespective, we consider the joint impact of treatment decisions on both cost and effectiveness and extend the concept of ITRs to a composite-outcome setting, so that we identify the most cost-effective ITR that accounts for individual heterogeneity. In particular, we propose to implement direct optimization by applying tree-based statistical learning algorithms to provide nonparametric estimation of the optimal ITR using a net-monetary-benefit-based reward. We provide several estimation approaches for the subject-specific reward which approately account for the treatment-outcome confounding and induced censoring issue in cost. CEAOptimalITR considers the heterogeneity in treatment effect among individuals, so, the resulting optimal decision rule is personalized/tailored according to subjects' characteristics.
